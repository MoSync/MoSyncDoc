<h1>Developing iPhone Applications</h1>
<p>All of Apple's iPhone, iPad and iPod touchscreen devices run the same operating system: iOS. Currently, the only way to download applications to an iOS device without voiding its warranty is via the Apple App Store. Here we provide advice on building successful iPhone apps with the MoSync SDK.<!--break--></p>
<p></p>
<h2>Building iOS Applications with the MoSync SDK</h2>
<p>Apple imposes strict rules and guidelines on how applications made available through its App Store are to be built. That means to successfuly build an iOS application with the MoSync SDK, you will need to install the <strong>MoSync SDK for OS X</strong> on an Apple Mac running <strong>Snow Leopard</strong> (OS X version 10.6). You will also need <strong>Xcode </strong>3.2.4 with the <strong>iPhone OS SDK</strong>. To build and distribute an application for anything else than the simulator you will need to join <a href="http://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/">Apple's Developer Program</a>.</p>
<p>If you do not have an Apple Mac available right now, you can install the <strong>MoSync SDK for Windows </strong>on an Windows machine. You will still be able to build your project, but the output will be an Xcode project which will then need to be built on an Apple Mac Snow Leopard running Xcode version 3.2.5.</p>
<h3>Building iOS Apps with the MoSync SDK for OS X</h3>
<ol>
<li>Set an iOS device (iPhone, iPad, etc.) as a <a href="TEMPLATE_DOC_PATH/sdk/tools/guides/ide/using-device-profiles/index.html">target device profile</a> in the MoSync IDE.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.mosync.com/documentation/manualpage/building-applications">Build your application</a>. An Xcode project will be created for you.</li>
<li>Open the Mac Finder and find the Xcode project file: <em>&lt;ProjectDirectory&gt;/Output/Release/Apple/iPhone/package/xcode-proj/&lt;ProjectName&gt;.xcodeproj</em></li>
<li>Double-click on the Xcode-project to open it with Xcode.</li>
<li>In Xcode, choose the target device or simulator that you want to build for.</li>
<li>Press <strong>Build and run</strong> to start the application on the target.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Building iOS Apps with the MoSync SDK for Windows</h3>
<ol>
<li>Set an iOS device (iPhone, iPad, etc.) as a <a href="TEMPLATE_DOC_PATH/sdk/tools/guides/ide/using-device-profiles/index.html">target device profile</a> in the MoSync IDE.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.mosync.com/documentation/manualpage/building-applications">Build your application</a>. An Xcode project will be created for you.</li>
<li>Open Windows Explorer and find the Xcode project file: <em>&lt;ProjectDirectory&gt;/Output/Release/Apple/iPhone/package/xcode-proj/&lt;ProjectName&gt;.xcodeproj</em></li>
<li>Move the created Xcode project to an Apple Mac Snow Leopard running Xcode to finalize the application.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Apple Guidelines and Exiting an App</h2>
<p>Apple provides&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide/StandardBehaviors/StandardBehaviors.html">detailed guidelines</a>&nbsp;describing how a well-behaved iPhone application should be written.</p>
<p>Generally, MoSync runtimes are completely conformant with Apple's guidelines, so you should have no trouble getting your application in the Apple App Store. Note, however, that Apple expects all applications to be closed by the "Home" button on their device, and are likely to reject applications which explicitly show an "Exit" button. If you want such a button on other platforms, simply skip it on iOS:</p>
<pre class="mosync-code-cpp">#include &lt;maprofile.h&gt;
...
#ifndef MA_PROF_SUPPORT_OS_IPHONEOS
   &lt;code for initializing an exit button&gt;
#endif
</pre>
<h2>Storing the Application's State</h2>
<p>An application may be closed when the phone receives a call or if the application uses too much memory. Therefore one thing users rely on is that the state of an application is stored at all times, so that when the application is restarted, its state can restored. This can easliy be implemented using MoSync's store syscalls defined in <strong>maapi.h</strong> (<strong>maOpenStore</strong>, <strong>maWriteStore</strong>...). When the application receives an EVENT_TYPE_CLOSE event, make sure you write the state to a store, so that it can be restored whenever the application is restarted.</p>
<h2>Image and Sound Support</h2>
<p>For <a href="TEMPLATE_DOC_PATH/sdk/tools/guides/ide/resource-compiler-tutorial/index.html">image resources</a>, iOS supports only JPEG and PNG formats.</p>
<p>For <a href="TEMPLATE_DOC_PATH/sdk/tools/guides/ide/adding-application-icons/index.html">application icons</a>, the MoSync SDK for OS X supports only SVG and PNG image formats. SVG images work well and get converted automatically by the SDK to PNG. To be able to use PNG images you will need to install the latest version of Image Magick: see issue <a href="http://jira.mosync.com/browse/MOSYNC-2308">MOSYNC-2308</a>.</p>
<p>The playback audio codecs are described in the&nbsp;<a href="http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/MultimediaPG/UsingAudio/UsingAudio.html">iOS Reference library</a></p>
<h2>Known Issues and Limitations</h2>
