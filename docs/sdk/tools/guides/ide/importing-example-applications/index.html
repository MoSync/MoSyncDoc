<h1>Importing the Examples</h1>
<p>The MoSync SDK comes with dozens of example apps in its <em>/examples</em> folder that demonstrate the use of its Libraries and API functions. Here we show you how to import the example applications into the MoSync IDE. For a description of each example application, see the <a href="http://www.mosync.com/content/example-applications">Example Applications</a> overview.</p>
<p><!--break--></p>
<p>There are two ways to import the example applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>On the MoSync <strong>Welcome</strong> screen, click the <span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>Import HTML5/JS Examples </strong></span>or the<span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong> <span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>Import C/C++ Examples </strong></span></strong></span>link. (To see the <strong>Welcome</strong> screen if it is closed, select <strong>Help </strong>&gt; <strong>Welcome</strong>). A new workspace will open with the selected examples loaded into it. (<strong>Note</strong>: If the examples already exist in the current workspace they are not replaced.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Select the <strong>Import</strong> menu option from the <strong>File</strong> menu, then select <strong>MoSync</strong> &gt; <strong>Existing MoSync project into workspace</strong>. Click <strong>Next</strong> and browse to the <em>/examples</em> folder in your MoSync folder. This method allows you to choose the workspace into which the example applications will be imported and to set various import options. See <a href="TEMPLATE_DOC_PATH/sdk/tools/guides/ide/building-and-running-examples/index.html">Importing Projects and Files</a> for information about the <strong>Import </strong>wizard.</li>
</ul>
<p>After import, the example application projects will be visible in the <strong>Project Explorer</strong>:</p>
<p><small><img src="images/help-welcome-example-workspace.png"></small></p>
<p>To build and run an example application in the MoRE emulator, open one of the examples in <strong>Project Explorer</strong>, then click the <strong>Run </strong>button <img src="images/mosync-run-button.png"> on the toolbar, or press <strong>Ctrl</strong>+<strong>F11</strong>.</p>
<p>Note that some examples (for example those that use NativeUI and OpenGLES) cannot be run in the MoRE emulator. They need to be transfered to a device (see <a href="TEMPLATE_DOC_PATH/sdk/tools/guides/ide/sending-to-device/index.html">Sending to a Device</a>).</p>
<p>We provide a description of all of our <a href="http://www.mosync.com/content/example-applications">example applications</a> including any requirements they have in our document library online and in the code of the application itself.</p>
