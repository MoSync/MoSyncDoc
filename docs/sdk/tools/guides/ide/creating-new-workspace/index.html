<h1>Organising Your Workspaces</h1>
<p>Workspaces are useful for organizing projects. For example you can use them to working with different versions of projects, or as sandboxes. Here we describe how to create workspaces and switch between them.</p>
<!--break--><h2>Creating a New Workspace</h2>
<p>From the <strong>File </strong>menu, select <strong>Switch Workspace</strong> &gt; <strong>Other</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Workspace Launcher</strong> will open:</p>
<p><img src="images/file-switch-workspace.png"></p>
<p>In the <strong>Workspace </strong>box, enter a name for your new workspace. W<strong></strong>orkspace names cannot include spaces â€” only alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and the underscore character (_).</p>
<p>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p>MoSync will restart with the new workspace loaded. (If the <strong>Welcome </strong>page opens, just close it.)</p>
<p>To add projects to your new workspace, see <a href="TEMPLATE_DOC_PATH/sdk/tools/guides/ide/building-and-running-examples/index.html">Importing Projects and Files</a>.</p>
<h2>Switching Workspaces</h2>
<p>To switch between your workspaces, select <strong>Switch Workspace</strong> from the <strong>File </strong>menu.</p>
<p>If you have already used the other workspace in this session, you can choose it directly from the pop-up menu. Otherwise, select <strong>Other </strong>to open the <strong>Workspace Launcher </strong>and browse for you workspace from there.</p>
<p>In the <strong>Workspace Launcher</strong> you have the option to copy the current workbench layout and working sets from the current workspace to the new one.</p>
