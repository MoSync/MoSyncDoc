<li>Please provide test cases, or sample code, or screen snapshots as <strong>attachments </strong>to your issue, if they are relevant.</li>
<li>If you know the exact area of the product where a bug is, use the issue <strong>labels </strong>to select the appropriate part of the product. The more accurately you label your issue, the faster we can process it.</li>
