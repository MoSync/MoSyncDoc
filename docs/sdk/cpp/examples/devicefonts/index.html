<h3>Behaviour</h3>
<p>When this application is started, it will present a list of the fonts that are installed in the device and the user can access. For devices that include more fonts than the screen can fit, the user is able to scroll through them.</p>
<p>The first column shows the font name, the second show how the font is printed using <strong>maDrawText </strong>and the third using <strong>maDrawTextW</strong>. Some fonts might be limited in the way that they can be drawn on the screen using these two functions.</p>
<h3>Touch responses</h3>
<ul>
<li>The user can scroll through the font list by dragging his finger vertically along the screen</li>
<li>The application is exited by pressing the back button.</li>
</ul>
