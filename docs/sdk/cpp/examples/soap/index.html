<h1>Soap</h1>
<p>This application demonstrates connecting to a Web Service using SOAP. It contains a class called <strong>SoapRequest</strong> which formats an easily modifiable XML Soap request, and a Moblet to test the SOAP communication using a currency converter as an example.<!--break--></p>

<p>This example is included in the MoSync SDK installation in the <em>/examples</em> folder. For information on importing the examples into your workspace, see <a href="TEMPLATE_DOC_PATH/sdk/tools/guides/ide/importing-example-applications/index.html">Importing the Examples</a>.<br><em style="color: #000000;"><br> Behaviour</em></p>
<p>When started, the application makes a call to Joel Hainley's Rot13 SOAP service, passing it the string "Hello World!" Rot13 is a simple substitution cypher, and therefore the service returns the string "Uryyb Jbeyq!"</p>
<p>The application demonstrates how to correctly format a SOAP request, and process a response from the web server. &nbsp;It can be easily modified to work with any web service. The screenshot above shows details of the commands being sent over SOAP and the responses, ending with a normal <strong>soapError </strong>of -6, indicating that the underlying HTTP connection has been closed.</p>
