<h1>HelloMAUI</h1>
<p>HelloMAUI is a well-commented example application for beginners. It consists of a very simple graphical user interface application that uses the MAUI library and Moblet framework. It illustrates how to create MAUI screens, and how to position and control widgets.<!--break--></p>

<p>This example is included in the MoSync SDK installation in the <em>/examples</em> folder. For information on importing the examples into your workspace, see <a href="TEMPLATE_DOC_PATH/sdk/tools/guides/ide/importing-example-applications/index.html">Importing the Examples</a>.</p>
<h3>Behaviour</h3>
<p>When run, the user is presented with a simple MAUI screen with the following widgets:</p>
<ul>
<li>a label widget with the instructions "Enter a password:"</li>
<li>an edit box operating in password mode,</li>
<li>two label widgets skinned as buttons.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the user types using the keypad keys the characters are echoed in the edit box. On clicking the <strong>Submit </strong>button, the password is validated. Examine the source code of the application (in the file <em>hellomaui.cpp</em>) to learn how the program works. The code commenting highlights various aspects of working with MAUI screens and widgets, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to define a screen,</li>
<li>How to identify the root of a screen's widget hierarchy,</li>
<li>How to use a layout widget to arrange other widgets,</li>
<li>How to define widgets and use their methods,</li>
<li>How to use skin and font resources,</li>
<li>How to shift focus and highlight widgets,</li>
<li>How to detect events and respond to them.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more advanced uses of MAUI, see our <a href="TEMPLATE_DOC_PATH/sdk/cpp/examples/mauiex/index.html" title="MAUIEx application example" id="ss-5">MAUIEx application example</a>. <br><br>To understand how MAUI and the NatuveUI Widget API (an alternative GUI solution that makes use of each platform's user interface controls), compare this example application with <a href="TEMPLATE_DOC_PATH/sdk/cpp/examples/hellonativeui/index.html">HelloNativeUI</a>.</p>
<h3>Key Presses</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tapping the screen's Clear button - clears the edit box.</li>
<li>Tapping the screen's Submit button - validates the contents of the edit box.</li>
<li>2-9 keypad keys - types text in multi-tap mode.</li>
<li>Up/down arrow keys - moves between buttons/edit box.</li>
<li>0 or right-softkey - exits the program.</li>
</ul>
