<h1>DatabaseTest</h1>
<p>This simple example application demonstrates how to use the MoSync <a href="TEMPLATE_DOC_PATH/sdk/cpp/guides/storage/sql-database-api/index.html">Database API</a>. This example works on all platforms supported by the API (see <a href="http://www.mosync.com/documentation/manualpages/featureplatform-matrix">Feature/Platfom Support</a>).<!--break--></p>

<h2><br>Getting the source code</h2>
<p><span>Unfortunately, <span>DatabaseTest</span> is missing from the examples folder included with MoSync SDK. You can get the code for the example from <span>GitHub</span>. The most recent version is here:</span><a href="https://github.com/MoSync/MoSync/blob/master/examples/cpp/DatabaseTest/main.cpp"><span>https://github.com/MoSync/MoSync/blob/master/examples/<span>cpp</span>/<span>DatabaseTest</span>/main.<span>cpp</span></span></a></p>
<p>But unless you are using nightly builds, it is recommended to use this version:<a href="https://github.com/MoSync/MoSync/blob/ThreeOne/examples/cpp/DatabaseTest/main.cpp"><span>https://github.com/MoSync/MoSync/blob/<span>ThreeOne</span>/examples/<span>cpp</span>/<span>DatabaseTest</span>/main.<span>cpp</span></span></a></p>
<p><span>This version is written to work with the current release (3.1). The latest version uses <span>maDBExecSQLParams</span>, which not yet in the release version of MoSync SDK.</span> If you create a new C++ project in the MoSync IDE and paste that code, it should work to run the example.</p>
<h2>Behaviour</h2>
<ul>
<li>The program has one screen that displays textual output.</li>
<li>Touch the screen to start running the database tests (or click on the screen in the MoSync Emulator).</li>
<li>A database file will be created on the device, in the local file system of the application.</li>
<li>If the test is successful, the text "Database test passed successfully" is displayed at the end of the output.</li>
<li>The program exits with a <a href="TEMPLATE_DOC_PATH/sdk/tools/references/mosync-panics-reference/index.html">panic message</a> if a test fails.</li>
<li>Quit the program by pressing back (on Android) or key zero (in the MoSync Emulator).</li>
</ul>
<h2>In the code</h2>
<p>The project consists of one file, <strong>main.cpp</strong>, which contains commented source code to help understand the Database API. The example database used has a table called "pet" which contains data about pets. The database is created by the program. The tests made include making queries and checking that the results match the expected values.</p>
