<h1>DatabaseTest</h1>
<p>This example application demonstrates how to use the MoSync <a href="TEMPLATE_DOC_PATH/sdk/cpp/guides/storage/sql-database-api/index.html">Database API</a>. The example works on all platforms supported by the API: Android, iOS, and the MoSync MoRE emulator.</p>

<h2>Behaviour</h2>
<ul>
<li>The program has one screen that displays textual output.</li>
<li>Tests start to run automatically when the app has been launched.</li>
<li>A database file will be created on the device, on the local file system of the application.</li>
<li>The status of the tests is displayed on the screen.</li>
<li>Quit the program by pressing back (on Android) or key zero (in the MoSync Emulator).</li>
</ul>

<h2>In the code</h2>
<p>The project consists of one source file, <a href="https://github.com/MoSync/MoSync/blob/ThreeThree/examples/cpp/DatabaseTest/main.cpp"><strong>main.cpp</strong></a>, which contains commented code to help understand the Database API. The example database used has a table called "pet" which contains data about pets. The database is created by the program. The tests made include making queries and checking that the results match the expected values.</p>
