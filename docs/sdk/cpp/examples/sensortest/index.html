<p>This example is included in the MoSync SDK installation in the /examples folder. For information on importing the examples into your workspace, see <a href="TEMPLATE_DOC_PATH/sdk/tools/guides/ide/importing-example-applications/index.html">Importing the Examples</a>.</p>
<h3>Behaviour</h3>
<p>This example application implements all of the sensor types supported by the MoSync Sensor API. When it is run on a device, it checks for the presence of each type of sensor and shows you the current event data being received from those that it finds.</p>
<h3>In the Code</h3>
<p>The project is divided into 2 files:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>main.cpp</strong> contains the main application logic, checking for sensors, listening for sensor events, and displaying current sensor data.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>consts.h</strong> contains the defines.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Touchscreen and key control</h3>
<p>Use the Back button to close the application.</p>
