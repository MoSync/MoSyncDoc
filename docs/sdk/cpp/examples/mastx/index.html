<h2>Behaviour</h2>
<p>The welcome screen (purple) should appear along with some text and a popup saying 'malloc failed'.</p>
<p>Without quoting all the text, it suffices to say it starts with 'Let's do some math...' and ends with 'Expect a panic'.</p>
<h2>Key Presses</h2>
<p>None of the keys should operate, only OK on the popup button.</p>
