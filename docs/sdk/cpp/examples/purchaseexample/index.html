<p>This application uses the <a href="http://www.mosync.com/files/imports/doxygen/latest/html/group___purchase_lib.html">MoSync Purchase C++ Library</a>, and works on all platforms supported by this library (see <a href="TEMPLATE_DOC_PATH/sdk/tools/references/feature-platform-support/index.html">Feature/Platform Support</a>).</p>
<p>This example is included in the MoSync SDK installation in the <em>/examples</em> folder. For information on importing the examples into your workspace, see <a href="TEMPLATE_DOC_PATH/sdk/tools/guides/ide/importing-example-applications/index.html">Importing the Examples</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: Before building and running this example app, you need to set your Android developer key, and the product IDs that can be purchased. Open the file <strong>config.h</strong> file in the project. You will find complete instructions for configuring the application there. Second, set up the project's provisioning profile by pointing it to the provision file -- that's the file that you get when you have registered with Apple as a developer and go through the iOS Provisioning Portal.</p>
</blockquote><h2 dir="ltr">Behaviour</h2>
<p>When this application is started, the <strong>MainScreen</strong> is shown.The screen consists of two main parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Buy" section with a <strong>BUY</strong> button and a list of available products for sale.</li>
<li>"History" section with a list of purchased items.</li>
</ul>
<p>From here the user can choose which products to purchase, by selecting a product (checking its corresponding check box). Tapping the <strong>BUY</strong> button initiates a purchase.</p>
<p>The purchase request is computed in the backend in the <strong>ApplicationController</strong> class. The <strong>ApplicationController</strong> notifies the <strong>MainScreen</strong> of all the purchase events, and displays them in dialog boxes, especially error messages.</p>
<h2>In the code</h2>
<p>The project is divided into several files:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Main.cpp</strong> is the application's main entry point.</li>
<li><strong>Config.h</strong> is where you must fill in your own Android developer public key.</li>
<li><strong>MainScreen.cpp</strong> the main screen of the application, that presents a list of available products, and a purchase history list.&nbsp; The first section will not display to the user the productIds, but the product names, and single-item selection is ensured by check boxes assigned to each one. The developer should create it's own product list in the <strong>createProductIdList</strong> method. For now, only Android has a product added, and that is a reserved product ID for testing. The second section (history) displays the names of the purchased products in a scrollable list view. Each item is selectable, and it's selection triggers the receipt dialog with all the receipt information.</li>
<li><strong>ApplicationController.cpp</strong> the controller that handles all purchase-related events. The controller is responsible for updating the UI with all purchase events.</li>
<li><strong>Util.cpp</strong> contains utility function for the application, to detect current platform.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you test on Android, make sure you follow the steps listed in the official help page for testing <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/market/billing/billing_testing.html">http://developer.android.com/guide/market/billing/billing_testing.html</a> , so that you will be able to test both reserved products and your own products.</p>
<p>The application's flow is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>when the user selects a product and presses BUY a new <strong>Purchase</strong> object (<strong>mCurrentPurchase</strong>) is created, and automatically the controller is set as&nbsp; a <strong>PurchaseListener</strong>. From now on, the current purchase object will point to <strong>mCurrentPurchase</strong>, and all purchases will be held in the <strong>mPurchases</strong> vector.</li>
<li>the <strong>ApplicationController</strong> class waits for <strong>productValid</strong> purchase event.</li>
<li>after the event is received, the purchase is requested: <strong>mCurrentPurchase-&gt;requestPurchase()</strong>.</li>
<li>the <strong>ApplicationController</strong> waits for <strong>requestCompleted</strong> purchase event.</li>
<li>the checkout UI is displayed, allowing the user to enter personal financial information.</li>
<li>after the event is received, the <strong>MainScreen</strong> is updated and the product name appears in the history list.</li>
<li>at any time, the user may select one purchased product, to get its receipt. Note that there may be a small delay in showing the receipt dialog, as the receipt validation is done asynchronously.</li>
</ul>
