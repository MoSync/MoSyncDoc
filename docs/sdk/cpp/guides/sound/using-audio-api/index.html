<h1>The Audio C API</h1>
<p>The MoSync Audio C API make it possible to play multiple audio tracks simultaneously on Android and iOS. In this guide we take a&nbsp; look at the functions in this API and give you two example programs which demonstrate the capabilities of this API.<!--break--></p>
<p></p>
<p>For a list of the platforms supported by the Audio C API, see <a href="TEMPLATE_DOC_PATH/sdk/tools/references/feature-platform-support/index.html">Feature/Platform Support</a>.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Creating something to play</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://www.mosync.com/files/imports/doxygen/latest/html/group___audio_a_p_i.html">MoSync Audio C API</a> provides a set of functions that make it possible to play background music and sound effects at the same time. The API is based on using two basic handles,&nbsp;<strong>MAAudioData</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>MAAudioInstance</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>MoSyncs old Sound API made use of resources created as .media or .umedia resources in the resource .lst file. The new system uses .ubin resources.</strong> These are just binary resources which will be loaded and used by the Audio APIs maAudioDataCreateFromResource call.<br><br>To create an <strong>MAAudioData</strong> resource, use the <strong>maAudioDataCreateFromResource</strong> or <strong>maAudioDataCreateFromURL</strong> functions. The first takes a bundled MoSync resource; the latter a URL.</p>
<ul>
<li>On Android, the URL accepts the protocols “http://”, “https://”, and "file:///".</li>
<li>On iOS it only accepts the "file://" protocol.</li>
<li>If no protocol is added it assumes it's a file path.</li>
<li>For protocol support on other platforms, see&nbsp; <a href="TEMPLATE_DOC_PATH/sdk/tools/references/feature-platform-support/index.html">Feature/Platform Support</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr">Streaming versus non-streaming resources</h2>
<p>Audio resources can be streaming or non-streaming. General platform limitations mean that you can only stream one audio resource at the time. Use the flag MA_AUDIO_DATA_STREAM to identify the audio resource as a streaming resource that should not be loaded into memory but should instead be streamed from disk or over HTTP. Set the flag to 0 (zero) for all other sounds otherwise you may get an error.</p>
<p>The streaming sound should, in a game perspective, be the background music while the non-streaming should be the sound effects.</p>
<p>Different platforms have different quirks so when creating your resources you should take some things in consideration. For sound effects, the most reliable format is MP3. For non-streaming sounds you should generally use short samples, a couple of seconds in length.<br><br>You must check your return values, if you get a value &lt; 0, something bad happened.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Creating an audio instance</h2>
<p>To be able to play an audio resource you first need to create an audio instance. Do this using the <strong>maAudioInstanceCreate</strong> function. If you get a return value which is not &lt;0 then you are ready to play the resource.</p>
<h2>Preparing a streaming audio resource</h2>
<p>For a streaming audio resource you need to prepare the sound — that is, start processing the file into memory. You can prepare the audio resource <strong>asynchronously</strong> or <strong>synchronously</strong>. Preparing it asynchronously is recommended. (If you try to play the sound before preparing it, it will automatically be prepared synchronously and if that is done over a slow internet connection your app may freeze for a few seconds.)</p>
<p>Call <strong>maAudioPrepare</strong> and set the <strong>async</strong> flag to <strong>1</strong>. The preparation will begin and you will receive an EVENT_TYPE_AUDIO_PREPARED event when it's finished buffering. This event will also contain the <strong>MAAudioInstance</strong> of the prepared sound.</p>
<p>There is no need to prepare non-streaming audio resources.</p>
<h2>Playing an audio resource</h2>
<p>Before playing a resource you can set the number of times the sound should loop using <strong>maAudioSetNumberOfLoops</strong>: <strong>0</strong> means play once, <strong>1</strong> means play twice, and so on. A loop value of <strong>-1</strong> means that it should loop forever.<br><br>The current resource instance can also has it’s volume changed with <strong>maAudioSetVolume</strong>. Volume is a value between <strong>0</strong> and <strong>1</strong> where <strong>0</strong> is mute and <strong>1</strong> is full volume.<br><br><strong>maAudioGetLength</strong> gets the length of the sound in milliseconds while <strong>maAudioSetPosition</strong> lets you set the position in the file. You can also use <strong>maAudioGetPosition</strong> to get the current position in the file in milliseconds from the start. Note that these three functions may not be available for non-streaming sounds on all platforms. Check your return values and you will be safe.<br><br><strong>maAudioPlay</strong> will start playing the sound. The EVENT_TYPE_AUDIO_COMPLETED event will be fired when it’s finished. If you have set the number of loops to <strong>1</strong> you will hear the sound play twice and then you will get the event.<br><br>During playback you can always use <strong>maAudioPause</strong> to pause the current playback and it will be resumed by calling <strong>maAudioPlay</strong> again.<br><br> When you call <strong>maAudioStop</strong> the sound might get unprepared which means that you need to prepare it again. If you want to stop playback and start at the beginning again it’s better to use <strong>maAudioSetPosition</strong> and set the position to <strong>0</strong>.<br><br>When you don’t need to play a sound anymore you can destroy the <strong>MAudioInstance</strong> with <strong>maAudioInstanceDestroy</strong>. If you want to clean up the sound data just use <strong>maAudioDataDestroy</strong> to destroy the <strong>MAAudioData</strong>.<br><br></p>
