<h1>Development Models</h1>
<p>MoSync supports several application development models. We call them the "classic procedural", "event driven, object oriented" and "full GUI-based". The model that you should choose when developing an application depends both on the type of application you are developing and your personal preference.</p>
<p><!--break--></p>
<h2>The Classic Procedural Model</h2>
<p>Using the classic procedural approach means starting out with an empty main function and implementing your own main loop, including all the event handling. <a href="TEMPLATE_DOC_PATH/sdk/cpp/guides/basic/classic-procedural-applications/index.html">Examples...</a></p>
<table border="1"><tbody><tr style="background-color: #e6e6fa;"><td><strong>Advantages</strong></td><td><strong>Disadvantages</strong></td><td><strong>When to use</strong></td></tr>
<tr><td><ul>
<li>Offers full control of the program flow</li>
<li>Provides ultimate flexibility in the design of the application</li>
<li>Supports programming in pure C, without C++</li>
<li>Resembles popular, procedural frameworks</li>
</ul>
</td><td><ul>
<li>All the burden of constructing well-behaved, resource efficient applications is on the programmer</li>
<li>Sometimes requires the programmer to reinvent the wheel</li>
<li>Might be unintuitive to people with a OOP background</li>
</ul>
</td><td><ul>
<li>Your application requires full control of the program flow and events</li>
<li>You want to implement your own higher-level layer on top</li>
<li>You prefer C over C++</li>
<li>You're porting existing code to MoSync</li>
</ul>
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<h2>The Event-Driven, Object-Oriented Model</h2>
<p>This approach is embodied in the use of the <strong>MAUtil::Moblet</strong> class. Inheriting it lets you implement functions such as <strong>keyPressEvent()</strong> instead of explicitly implementing an event loop yourself while providing <strong>TimerListeners</strong> and <strong>IdleListeners</strong> to facilitate execution of code outside of responding to events. <a href="TEMPLATE_DOC_PATH/sdk/cpp/guides/basic/event-driven-object-oriented-applications/index.html">Examples...</a></p>
<table border="1"><tbody><tr style="background-color: #e6e6fa;"><td><strong>Advantages</strong></td><td><strong>Disadvantages</strong></td><td><strong>When to use</strong></td></tr>
<tr><td><ul>
<li>Takes care of boilerplate event handling correctly</li>
<li>Provides higher-level abstraction of program flow</li>
<li>Produces well-behaved, resource efficient programs by default</li>
<li>Resembles popular, event driven frameworks</li>
</ul>
</td><td><ul>
<li>Imposes a predefined application lifecycle model</li>
<li>Might be awkward for frame-based applications such as games</li>
<li>Requires use of C++</li>
</ul>
</td><td><ul>
<li>Most of the time when the GUI-based approach below is overkill</li>
</ul>
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<h2>The Full GUI-Based Model</h2>
<p>Using the <strong>MAUI </strong>library, you gain access to a variety of ready-made widgets such as labels, list boxes, text edit boxes, images, and layouts. You add logic by registering different types of listeners with the widgets, thus responding to higher-level events than with Moblets - things like selection and slider position changes. <a href="TEMPLATE_DOC_PATH/sdk/cpp/guides/maui/gui-based-applications-with-maui/index.html">Examples...</a></p>
<table border="1"><tbody><tr style="background-color: #e6e6fa;"><td><strong>Advantages</strong></td><td><strong>Disadvantages</strong></td><td><strong>When to use<br></strong></td></tr>
<tr><td><ul>
<li>Allows rapid development of GUI applications</li>
<li>Reduces program flow programming to responding to GUI events</li>
</ul>
</td><td><ul>
<li>Imposes a predefined UI model</li>
<li>Requries familiarity with the MAUI library</li>
<li>Requires use of C++</li>
</ul>
</td><td><ul>
<li>Whenever you're developing a reasonably traditional GUI application</li>
<li>When radically cutting development time outweighs full customizability</li>
</ul>
