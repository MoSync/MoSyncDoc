<h1>Extending HTML5 Apps with Lua</h1>
<p>MobileLua is a port of Lua to MoSync. There are two ways to author MobleLua apps:</p>
<ul>
<li>The easiest way is by using the MoSync Mobile IDE, and this is the way you need to use when developing a stand-alone app that can be deployed to the app stores.<br><br></li>
<li>The alternative way is to use LuaLive, an editor and client app that supports live editing and interactive development of Lua apps. This is a great way to experiment and learn Lua. It is also a very productive way of developing MobileLua apps as it dramatically cuts down the edit/build/deploy cycle.</li>
</ul>
