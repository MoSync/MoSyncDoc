<h1>Updating Your Wormhole App</h1>
<p>When using a new version of the MoSync SDK or MoSync Reload, you should update your existing HTML5 apps. This guide takes you through the process.<!--break--></p>
<p></p>
<h2>What Needs To Be Updated?</h2>
<p>To make sure that your existing apps work with the latest versions of the MoSync tools, note the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>For MoSync Reload you have to update the file wormhole.js and make sure you are using the most recent Reload Client. Download it from the app stores, or go to the <a href="http://www.mosync.com/download/reload">Reload download page</a>, to get the latest version.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>For apps you build using MoSync SDK you should update wormhole.js and check the C++ code in main.cpp.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Update wormhole.js</h2>
<p>The file wormhole.js contains the JavaScript source code for the Wormhole library. Make sure your project uses the latest version of this file. This file is located in the LocalFiles/js folder in your project. Just delete the old version and paste in the new version.</p>
<p>If you use MoSync Reload, here are two alternative ways to obtain the new version of wormhole.js:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new project with the new version of Reload, select the project and click Open. Copy the js/wormhole.js file and paste it into your existing project to replace the old version.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Get it from the Reload install directory. On <strong>OS X</strong> this is: <strong><br>/Applications/Reload/Contents/Resources/templates/ReloadTemplates/LocalFiles/js/wormhole.js</strong> <br>On <strong>Windows </strong>and<strong> Linux</strong> the directory is:<strong><br>&lt;directory-where-you-unpacked-reload&gt;/server/templates/ReloadTemplate/LocalFiles/js/wormhole.js</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you use MoSync SDK, here two alternative ways to find wormhole.js (note that the wormhole.js used in Reload and the SDK is the exact same file):</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new project in the MoSync IDE using the HTML5/JS WebUI Template. Copy the LocalFiles/js/wormhole.js file and paste it into your existing project to replace the old version.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Get it from the MoSync SDK install directory. On <strong>OS X</strong> this is: <strong><br>/Applications/MoSync/templates/HTML5 JS WebUI Project/wormhole.js</strong> <br>On <strong>Windows </strong>the directory is:<strong><br>&lt;directory-where-you-installed-mosync&gt;/templates<strong>/HTML5 JS WebUI Project/wormhole.js</strong></strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>Update your C++ code</h2>
<p>Note that class WebAppMoblet has been deprecated, it is replaced by class HybridMoblet.</p>
<p>If you have an old project where main.cpp is not modified, you can just replace that one with the main.cpp from a project created with the most recent MoSync SDK.</p>
<p>If you have modified the main.cpp file you have to replace references to WebAppMoblet with HybridMoblet, and then manually update your code. The best way of knowing what needs to be changed, is to create a new HTML5/JS project in the MoSync SDK IDE (Eclipse) and inspect that code to see what changes have been made.</p>
