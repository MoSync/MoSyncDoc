<p>This simple example application demonstrates the use of HTML markup for creating multi-level native user interfaces. It also shows how to use other JavaScript modules (such as sensors) with the MoSync JavaScript NativeUI API.</p>

<p>This example runs on all platforms supported by both the MoSync Wormhole JavaScript Library and NFC C++ Library (see <a href="http://www.mosync.com/documentation/manualpages/featureplatform-matrix">Feature/Platform Support</a>). It requires a device with NFC capabilities.</p>
<p>This example is included in the MoSync SDK installation in the <em>/examples</em> folder. For information on importing the examples into your workspace, see <a href="TEMPLATE_DOC_PATH/sdk/tools/guides/ide/importing-example-applications/index.html">Importing the Examples</a>.</p>
<h2>Behavior</h2>
<p>When started, this example application on Android and iOS displays three tabs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Device</strong>  shows device information. It also includes two buttons, that cause the device to vibrate or make a beep sound.</li>
<li><strong>Sensors </strong> shows three buttons for accessing three different sensors: Accelerometer, Location, and Compass. Pressing each one of the buttons in the second tab will start the sensor and update the data on screen.</li>
<li><strong>Map </strong> shows another web view with google maps loaded by default.</li>
</ul>
<p>On Windows Phone 7 the tabs are translated into pivots.</p>
<h2>In the code</h2>
<p>The following technologies are used in this application:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML5, Javascript thourgh the Wormhole JavaScript Library for creating native user interfaces.</li>
<li>Wormhole device access modules (PhoneGap-compatible) to access sensors and etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>main.cpp</strong> is the main C/C++ application file. You do not need to modify this file: you can just use the JavaScript interface. All of the HTML5 and JavaScript-related files and libraries are located in the <em>/LocalFiles</em> directory, are included in the application when it is built in the MoSync IDE. Inside that folder you can see the following files:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>index.html </strong> Main html file which will be loaded and parsed by MoSync. In includes HTML markups for generating the UI.</li>
<li><strong>js/wormhole.js </strong> Wormhole JavaScript Library that includes all of the available API.</li>
<li><strong>js/main.js </strong> Applications JavaScript file which provides wrappers for accessing sensors and other device features.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>/Resources.lst</em> file has a default entry for the bundled files that should not be removed unless the user wants to remove all the HTML5 functionality.</p>
