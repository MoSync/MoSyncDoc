<h1>WebViewGeoLocation</h1>
<p>The WebViewGeoLocation application displays your current location, as returned by EVENT_TYPE_LOCATION events. This example is useful for understanding the basic mechanisms for communicating between JavaScript and C++.<!--break--></p>

<p>This example is included in the MoSync SDK installation in the <em>/examples</em> folder. For information on importing the examples into your workspace, see <a href="TEMPLATE_DOC_PATH/sdk/tools/guides/ide/importing-example-applications/index.html">Importing the Examples</a>.</p>
<p>You will find the latest version of the source code of the app at the <a href="https://github.com/MoSync/MoSync/tree/master/examples/WebViewGeoLocation/">MoSync GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<h2>Behaviour</h2>
<p>When this application starts up on an Android of iOS device, the main screen is displayed. Touch the <strong>Start</strong> button to start tracking the current latitude and longitude of the device. Touch the <strong>Stop </strong>button to stop tracking.</p>
<h2>In the Code</h2>
<p>The purpose of the example is to demonstrate how to communicate between JavaScript in a <strong>WebView </strong>widget and C++ code, by using basic low-level syscalls and events.</p>
<p>(Other <strong>WebView </strong>examples, such as <span style="color: #000000;"><a href="TEMPLATE_DOC_PATH/sdk/js/examples/webviewtwitter/index.html">WebViewTwitter</a>,</span> demonstrate how to use the high-level MoSync Wormhole Library for such communications.)</p>
<p>The application is implemented in C++, HTML and JavaScript. It has an explicit event loop, rather than using a Moblet, to let you see how the basic event mechanism that handle messages from JavaScript works.</p>
<p>The user interface for this application is created in HTML: to keep the example code to a minimum, the example uses only very basic HTML tags and no CSS.</p>
<p>When the program starts, a single <strong>WebView </strong>widget is created. The HTML and JavaScript code is stored in a text file and packaged with the application as a binary resource. That resource is extracted when the program starts, and the web view is set to display that data. This is done in C++ code, in file <em>GeoLocation.cpp</em>.</p>
<p>The communication mechanism for invoking C++ code from JavaScript is based on the MAW_EVENT_WEB_VIEW_HOOK_INVOKED event (note that in MoSync 2.7, the URL hook mechanism was used, this method is still available, but is not supported to the full extent on Windows Phone 7).</p>
<p>In file <em>Resources/index.html</em>, the following JavaScript code is evaluated when clicking the <strong>Start</strong> button:</p>
<pre class="mosync-code-js">mosync.bridge.sendRaw("StartTrackingGeoLocation");</pre>
<p>The result will be that a MAW_EVENT_WEB_VIEW_HOOK_INVOKED is posted to the MoSync event queue, and the following C++ code in WebViewGeoLocation.cpp is called:</p>
<pre class="mosync-code-cpp">case EVENT_TYPE_WIDGET:
    handleWidgetEvent((MAWidgetEventData*) event.data);
    break;
</pre>
<p>In the <strong>handleWidgetEvent </strong>method the following code gets called, which causes location tracking to start, and location events to be sent to the event queue:</p>
<pre class="mosync-code-cpp">if (0 == message.find("StartTrackingGeoLocation"))
{
    maLocationStart();
}
</pre>
<p>When a location event is sent, the following code is used to communicate the location back to JavaScript to update the web page:</p>
<pre class="mosync-code-cpp">case EVENT_TYPE_LOCATION:
    handleGeoLocationEvent((MALocation*) event.data);
    break;

void handleGeoLocationEvent(MALocation* location)
{
    char script[512];
    sprintf(
        script,
        "javascript:GeoLocationUpdated('%f','%f');",
        location-&gt;lat,
        location-&gt;lon);
    maWidgetSetProperty(mWebView, "url", script);
}
</pre>
<p>Calling <strong>maWidgetSetProperty </strong>on a <strong>WebView </strong>widget, with the property "url" set to a string that has the "javascript:" scheme will cause that <strong>JavaScript </strong>code to be evaluated in the web view.</p>
<p>By using the above techniques, you can communicate asynchronously between JavaScript and C++ code.</p>
<p>The JavaScript object <strong>moync.bridge</strong> is also defined in <em>index.html</em>. Note that this is a stripped-down version of the mosync-bridge object included in the Wormhole JavaScript Library (wormhole.js).</p>
<p>This example is intended to be a low-level example that illustrates the basic mechanism of communication between JavaScript and C/C++. In most cases it should be much more convinient to use the higher-level Wormhole library, which encapsulates and abstracts away low-level details and platform differences.</p>
