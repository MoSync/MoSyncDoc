<h1>What's New in MoSync SDK 3.1</h1>
<p>Our 3.1 release of the MoSync SDK introduces a new C++ library and C API for managing in-app purchases. We've consolidated our support for the Windows Phone 7 platform and created an App Showcase to help you publicize your apps. We have also created some great new tutorials and user guides, and upgraded many aspects of our website to make it even easier to get started with the MoSync SDK. Let's take a look.<!--break--></p>
<p></p>
<h2><a href="TEMPLATE_DOC_PATH/HOME_PATH/index.html">Support for In-App Purchases</a></h2>
<p><em>Android and iOS</em></p>
<p>If you are serious about app development, sooner or later you will want to provide your users with a way to purchase products—like upgrades, extensions, or related apps—from within your own application. Our new Purchase C API and its C++ Library wrapper makes it easy for your to offer your users products they can purchase, for your users to view their purchase and refund histories, and for you to track each user's transaction status. Monetizing your apps has never been simpler! <a href="TEMPLATE_DOC_PATH/sdk/cpp/guides/libs/purchase-library-and-api/index.html">Module overview</a> | <a href="TEMPLATE_DOC_PATH/sdk/cpp/guides/purchases/managing-app-purchases/index.html">Tutorial </a>| <a href="http://www.mosync.com/files/imports/doxygen/latest/html/group___purchase_lib.html">C++ Library Reference</a> | <a href="http://www.mosync.com/files/imports/doxygen/latest/html/group___purchase_a_p_i.html">C API Reference</a> | <a href="TEMPLATE_DOC_PATH/sdk/cpp/examples/purchaseexample/index.html">Example application</a>.</p>
<h2>Number &amp; Time Pickers on Windows Phone</h2>
<p><em>Windows Phone 7</em></p>
<p>We have extended our <a href="TEMPLATE_DOC_PATH/sdk/cpp/guides/nativeui/using-nativeui-library/index.html">NativeUI C++ Library</a> with support for the <a href="http://www.mosync.com/files/imports/doxygen/latest/html/class_native_u_i_1_1_number_picker.html">Number Picker</a> and <a href="http://www.mosync.com/files/imports/doxygen/latest/html/class_native_u_i_1_1_time_picker.html">Time Picker</a> widgets on Microsoft's Windows Phone 7 platform. That makes it easy to provide your users with the native widgets they expect when picking definable ranges of values and times. We've also implemented alert boxes (maAlert) and application option bars (maWidgetScreenAddOptionsMenuItem) <a href="http://www.mosync.com/files/imports/doxygen/latest/html/maapi_8h.html">IOCTL</a>s on Windows Phone 7. <a href="http://www.mosync.com/files/imports/doxygen/latest/html/group___native_u_i_lib.html">C++ Library Reference</a> | <a href="http://www.mosync.com/files/imports/doxygen/latest/html/group___widget_a_p_i.html">C API Reference</a> | <a href="http://www.mosync.com/documentation/manualpages/featureplatform-matrix">Feature/Platform Matrix</a>.</p>
<h2>Improved Date Picker Widget</h2>
<p><em>Windows Phone 7</em></p>
<p>We've upgraded the <a href="http://www.mosync.com/files/imports/doxygen/latest/html/group___native_u_i_lib.html">NativeUI C++ Library</a>'s <a href="http://www.mosync.com/files/imports/doxygen/latest/html/class_native_u_i_1_1_date_picker.html">Date Picker</a> widget so that you can now define on Windows Phone 7 the range of dates the user can select from. That's something which has not been possible to do out-of-the-box on Microsoft's platform and should reduce many coding headaches. <a href="http://www.mosync.com/files/imports/doxygen/latest/html/group___native_u_i_lib.html">C++ Library Reference</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.mosync.com/showcase">New App Showcase</a><em></em></h2>
<p>Have you built an app with the MoSync SDK or with MoSync Reload? Our new <a href="http://www.mosync.com/showcase">App Showcase</a> helps you promote your work and make it visible to iPhone, Android, and Windows Phone users, and also help us demonstrate the power of MoSync's tools to build cool, innovative apps. If you have created an app with the MoSync SDK or with MoSync Reload and have published on a store, why not visit our website, log in and <a href="http://www.mosync.com/node/add/application">submit your app's details</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.mosync.com/content/search-mosync">Improved Web Site Search</a></h2>
<p>We have a huge number of user guides, tutorials, and reference manuals online, as well as dozens of blog posts, white papers, forum topics, and other interesting resources. Our old search engine just couldn't cope with the sheer volume of documentation so we've moved to a better, faster Google-based search. Our <a href="http://www.mosync.com/content/search-mosync">new search engine</a> returns results from our main web site, the MoSync <a href="http://www.mosync.com/forum">discussion forums</a>, our <a href="https://github.com/MoSync/MoSync">GitHub repository</a>, the <a href="http://jira.mosync.com/">Jira Issue tracker</a>, and several other MoSync-related sites, making it much easier to find what you are looking for.</p>
