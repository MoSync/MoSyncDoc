# Example MoSync Documentation Page

## Page structure

Comment with meta tags goes at the top.

Use one and only one h1 header for the title of the page.

Use h2 headers for sub sections.

Do not line-break paragraps, make the editor soft-wrap your lines. Like in this paragraph that is written as one long line that wraps in the editor.

Save files as UTF-8.

## Good to know

You can always insert HTML code into a Markdown document.
